# T20Best11

1. Implemented a Power BI report to identify the top 11 players for a T20 cricket team by scraping data from espn cricinfo with a Brightdata website tool.
2. Used the resulting Power BI dashboard to select players for various categories (openers, middle order/anchors, finishers, allâ€‘rounders, specialist fast bowlers) and ultimately choose the top 11 players to play in the match.
3. Selected team using the Power BI dashboard has a 90 percent of a chance winning the game.
